        "Technology use before bed can negatively impact sleep. The blue light emitted by electronic devices suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles.",
        "Using electronic devices before bed can lead to difficulty falling asleep, shorter sleep duration, and poorer sleep quality.",
        "Blue light is a high-energy light emitted by electronic devices, which can interfere with the body's natural sleep-wake rhythm. Exposure to blue light in the evening can make it harder to fall asleep and disrupt the quality of sleep.",
        "To mitigate the effects of technology on sleep, it's recommended to limit or avoid electronic device use in the evening, especially in the hour before bedtime. Using blue light filters or wearing blue light-blocking glasses can also help.",
        "Ideally, electronic devices should be avoided before bedtime to promote optimal sleep. Instead, engaging in relaxing activities, such as reading a book or taking a warm bath, can support better sleep.",
        "While technology can have negative effects on sleep, there are also apps and devices available that can help track and improve sleep. These tools can provide insights into sleep patterns, offer relaxation techniques, or play soothing sounds to aid in falling asleep."
